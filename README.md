# Plate Swaps 🍽
A QB based script for stealing plates and attaching them to other vehicles. Plates are added to inventory as items. The original plates for player owned vehicles are left untouched in the database, and you can always swap back to original plates from a fakeplate.

It does come with some limitations currently. You can not park your vehicles with a fake plate on without editing your garage script (see last section of readme for examples). Modifying a vehicle will not save changes in database (same thing as garages). The script is also set up to not allow stealing player-plates. Just because this might cause problems with saving in databases etc, a toggle to enable this at your own risk might be introduced.

["licenseplate"] =          {["name"] = "licenseplate",         ["label"] = "License Plate",                  ["weight"] = 1, ["type"] = "item", ["image"] = "licenseplate.png", ["unique"] = true, ["useable"] = true, ['shouldClose'] = false, ["combinable"] = nil, ["description"] = "A license plate for a vehicle"},


```

## Being able to park or modify cars with fake plates
You'll have to figure this out yourself. Somewhere in the scripts, wherever there's a plate check that compares to the database you'll need to use the exports `isFakePlate` to check the plates and then `getRealPlateFromFakePlate` to get the real plate you want to modify. 

Example use: Let's say you have a script where it needs to check the car in the database. It obviously uses plate to map to something in the db, but your plate is fake! Naughty Naughty!
In the code the plate of the car is `plate` and the vehicle entity is `veh`.
```
exports['cw-plateswap']:resetPlateIfFake(plate, veh)
```
After this is used, your car will have it's real plate, but keep the fake plate in the db.

Whenever you want to put the fake plate back on you can call this:
```
exports['cw-plateswap']:applyFakePlateIfExists(plate, veh)
```

Example of implementation in qb-garages (gotta honk twice to park lol):
