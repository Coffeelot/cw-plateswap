# Plate Swaps üçΩ
A QB based script for stealing plates and attaching them to other vehicles. Plates are added to inventory as items. The original plates for player owned vehicles are left untouched in the database, and you can always swap back to original plates from a fakeplate.

It uses qb-phone for the police alert by default, if you want to change it then you can find the Event trigger at the bottom of `server.lua`

## Being able to park or modify cars with fake plates
You'll have to figure this out yourself. Somewhere in the scripts, wherever there's a plate check that compares to the database you'll need to use the exports `isFakePlate` to check the plates and then `getRealPlateFromFakePlate` to get the real plate you want to modify. 

Example use:
```
local isFakePlate = exports['cw-plateswap']:isFakePlate(vehiclePlate)
local realPlate = nil
if isFakePlate then
    realPlate = exports['cw-plateswap']:isFakePlate(getRealPlateFromFakePlate)
end
```
Now you can use `realPlate` somewhere as the plate to check DB or whatever. Good luck.
